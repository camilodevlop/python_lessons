# python_lessons
This repository contains the solved exercises proposed in the python courses.

- U_python: in this directory are available the codes of both the solved exercises proposed in the Udemy's course "Universidad Python con Frameworks", and other short projects. Some of these projects are described below.


    - 28_project_users_data_layer: in this project, a Data-Access Layer (DAL) was implemented using Python. This DAL was used to access a database managed     through PostgreSQL. The information in the database was contained in a table which consisted of three columns: id_user, username, and password. The         "UserDAO' class was programmed to interact with these columns through CRUD statements. The connection pool, connections, commits, and rollbacks were       managed by the "Connection" and "Cursor_Pool" classes. Finally, users interact with the database from a terminal via both the "list_users.py" script       and the "User" class.
